 ## Description
 For week 11, my challenge was to use Express.js to add functionality to a pre-created note-taker application. The purpose of this application was to use Express.js backend which would allow the user to create notes and save it onto the application which they could then later select to view.

 ## Installation
 Installing this application is simple. Just simply visit my Github and look for this repo. You have a choice of either cloning it or downloading as a zip and running on your personal station yourself.

 ## Usage
 As stated in the description the main usage of this project was to use Express.js to provide the backend functions of the application.

 ## Contributions
 For this project I would like to give credit to Matthew Kang a classmate in my Bootcamp who helped me with the troubleshooting my server.js file.<br />
 I also referenced old assignments from week 11 used them to help me get a foundation and a sense of direction when starting this challenge.
